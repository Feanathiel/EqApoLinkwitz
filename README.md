# EqApoLinkwitz

Tool I'm using to create an equalizer based on a [Linkwitz transformation](https://www.minidsp.com/applications/advanced-tools/linkwitz-transform) for [Equalizer APO](https://sourceforge.net/projects/equalizerapo/).

Ideally, save to a new file and include it into the main configuration.
